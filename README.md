##Data Science Resources

This repo is here to provide some free and available resources from the internet.  It is intended to be an aid to practicing or aspiring Data Scientists.  Mostly it is a repo so that I can keep track of resources that were helpful at a given time along this journey of acquiring new skills.  

The original plan is to break down resources in terms of skills necessary in each element of the data pipeline.  As I began to think about this and in an effort to keep this organized and comprehensible to other people - it also makes sense to have some resources about theoretical elements of data science and how data science can be relevant to a company (i.e. use cases).

As well I will include some links to other relevant aggregation sites for data science resourcse as I recognize that I am certainly not the only person doing this and there are a lot of good resources currently available.  

If you have anything to add definitely let me know...


Each section of the data pipeline:

###Scripting Languages:
As I use predominantly python - I will keep this as the language of choice for other libraries - R is another language many Data Scientist's use. I enjoy using python as it has more applicability to work with other environments and problems aside from data analysis and it has many useful libraries.
